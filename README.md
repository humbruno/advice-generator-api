## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) using Fetch and Async functions

### What I learned

This project was a great way to put into practice my JavaScript skills by handling promises.

Async functions are incredibly simple yet powerful to use, and certainly a good solution to "callback hell"!

I also tried the same solution using `.then` and `.catch` without the async functions which achieved the same results. I am not yet sure when to choose one over the other. Definitely something to do more research on!
